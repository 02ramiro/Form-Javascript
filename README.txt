Welcome to Ramiro Carbajal's project.

My project involves a registration and login form.

The registration form will ask for your first name, last name, email, and password.
Once you complete it, you'll proceed to the login stage, where you'll need to enter your email and the previously set password.
If you input the wrong email, the website will say 'User not found.'
If you enter the wrong password, the website will inform you 'Passwords do not match.'
And if you enter everything correctly, the website will say 'Login successful. Welcome, (your email).'
